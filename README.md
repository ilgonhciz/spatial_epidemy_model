# Spatial Epidemy Model
This repository provide the source code to model the spatial spreading of disease on a country level. The framework allows the user to incorporate different layers of spreading medium: 

1. Local transmission (usually involving short distance movement e.g. foot, bus) and 

2. long distance travel e.g. train, airplane. 

A example is already done for the USA and Switzerland.
